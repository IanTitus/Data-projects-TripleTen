* **Original File Name:** nyc_airbnb_data_v2.xlsx

## Methodology
The analysis was performed entirely within Google Sheets, leveraging its powerful formula capabilities and data manipulation features. Key steps included:

* **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
    * Utilized built-in pivot table functions, charts, and rudimentary formulas.
    * Copied only relevant data from 'Listings (raw)' to the 'Listings' sheet.
    * Applied bold text and aesthetically formatted headers.
    * Centered all text in cells for enhanced accessibility.
    * Cleaned data in the 'bedroom' column of the 'listings' tab to replace blank cells with "0".

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Calculate most popular neighborhoods and present information in pie chart.
    * Calculate number of bedrooms by neighborhood to determine most popular sized listings.
    * Calculate the number of 1 bedroom listings by neighborhood.
    * Calculate total revenue earned per listing to determine the listing with highest value.
    * Calculate which property sizes (number of bedrooms) were most popular.

* **Key Analytical Areas:**
    * **Top Listings Analysis:** Identified the most attractive vacation rentals by finding the highest earning listings.
    * **Neighborhood Performance:** Determined which neighborhoods were most popular based on the quantity of reviews made within each neighborhood.
    * **Bedroom Count Analysis:** Determined the property sizes by finding what percent of listings had between 0 and 8 bedrooms in each neighborhood.
    * **Specific Neighborhood Deep Dive:** Determined how many 1 bedroom listings are in each neighborhood to show the 3 best neighborhoods to find a 1 bedroom listing.
    * **Calendar Data Review:** Calculation of how much revenue each listing earned with showing the minimum and maximum rentable nights.

## Key Findings & Insights
* The top listing earns more than twice the amount of the fifth top listing.
* Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, Harlem are the three most popular neighborhoods for rentals.
* Midtown is the only neighborhood where studios are the most commonly rented size.
* More than half of the listings have 1 bedroom.
